reportbug (2.47) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The dependency relationships between reportbug and Python's locale
    support modules have changed in this version of reportbug:
  
    . python2.3-iconvcodec is now a Recommendation.
    . python2.3-cjkcodec is now recommended as an alternative.
  
    Users of Unicode (UTF-*), ISO-8859-*, and KOI8 locales may use
    reportbug without either module installed.  These encodings are
    supported by the base install of Python 2.3.
    
    Users of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean-language locales who do not use
    a UTF encoding should use python2.3-cjkcodec.
  
    Users of other locales should use python2.3-iconvcodec.
  
  * In addition, reportbug will now issue a warning on startup if the
    encoders installed on your system are insufficient for encoding the
    character set used by your locale.  (Previously, this would lead to a
    mysterious crash with a "LookupError" later in the reporting process.)
