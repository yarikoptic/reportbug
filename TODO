Silly TODO list (in no particular order):

1. Interface abstraction and multiple interfaces.  The menus in
   reportbug can be handled by a set of UI functions in a Python
   module.  reportbug_ui_text is there; reportbug_ui_newt is coming,
   but its menu implementation leaves something to be desired... a new
   menu may have to be designed from scratch, or we may have to
   reimplement the nice newt dialogs in slang (boo, hiss).  Robin
   Putters has done quite a lot of work on a GNOME interface.

   I'm not sure UI abstration is actually the way to go any more.
   More thinking required here.

2. debconf: probably not; we have per-user configuration, which is
   better 99.9% of the time.

3. BTS management interface for developers.  You should be able to
   view the list of bug reports for a package, construct a list of
   actions, and produce one giant email to control@bugs.debian.org to
   do that.  Forwarding and merging, which both can be major PITAs,
   will be helpful.  (See #157283)

4. i18n/l10n.  Python includes gettext support; however, the
   Python-2.x interface is much better so reportbug will be using that
   when 2.1 makes it in.  (i18n/l10n with reportbug may not make much
   sense, since the reports have to be in English for most maintainers
   to understand them... unless we figure out some way to get bug
   reports translated for maintainers.)

5. Iterators (2.3): Use enumerate instead of range where possible.

6. Convert BTS code to use the mbox-format reports if available, as
   they should be easier to parse.

7. Convert the modules to a proper package and stick it in the Python
   search path (per #157079).  Reform the names.  Rename
   "reportbug.py" to something sensible.

8. Allow followups from the command line using a specific bug number,
   rather than requiring people to go through the browser.  Coupled
   with --query-only, this should allow me to drop querybts
   completely.  (See #223335)

9. Allow a --body option with a filename; this would prefill the
   "body" section of the report.  Might be useful for frontends.

10. Document reportbug.conf properly.
